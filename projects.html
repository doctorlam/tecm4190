	  	<h3>Project 1 - Copyediting Test - 15%</h3>
	  		<h4>Description</h4>
	  			<p>For this first assignment, you will copyedit an actual test from industry. You may edit this test on paper or electronically. The publisher gives you as much time as you like to complete the test, so you can guess that they expect perfection. In this class you only have a week and a half, so I acknowledge it won't be as perfect as if you'd had endless weeks.</p>
	  			<p>You may use any reference to help answer your questions-this test is open book. However, you'll notice in the letter that the publisher uses the Chicago Manual of Style, 14th edition, but we use the 16th edition (the answer key has been updated) because that's what you need practice with. For this test, the Chicago's answer is the right answer. That's the ultimate reference I want you to use. For a dictionary, use www.m-w.com the Merriam Webster site.</p>
	  		<h3>Project 2 - Editing Job Materials - 15%</h3>
